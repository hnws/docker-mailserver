[`setup.sh`][github-file-setupsh] is an administration script that helps with the most common tasks, including initial configuration. It is intended to be used from the host machine, _not_ from within your running container.

The latest version of the script is included in the `docker-mailserver` repository. You may retrieve it at any time by running this command in your console:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/master/setup.sh
chmod a+x ./setup.sh
```

!!! info

    Make sure to get the `setup.sh` that comes with the release you're using. Look up the release and the git commit on which this release is based upon by selecting the appropriate tag on GitHub. This can done with the "Switch branches/tags" button on GitHub, choosing the right tag. This is done in order to rule out possible inconsistencies between versions.

## Usage

Run `./setup.sh help` and you'll get some usage information:

SETUP(1)

NAME
    setup.sh - docker-mailserver administration script

SYNOPSIS
    ./setup.sh [ OPTIONS... ] COMMAND [ help | ARGUMENTS... ]

    COMMAND := { email | alias | quota | config | relay | debug } SUBCOMMAND

DESCRIPTION
    This is the main administration script that you use for all interactions with your
    mail server. Setup, configuration and much more is done with this script.

    Please note that the script executes most of the commands inside the container itself.
    If the image was not found, this script will pull the :latest tag of
    mailserver/docker-mailserver. This tag refers to the latest release,
    see the tagging convention in the README under
    https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/blob/master/README.md

    You will be able to see detailed information about the script you are invoking and
    its arguments by appending help after your command. Currently, this
    does not work with all scripts.

VERSION
    The current version of this script is backwards compatible with versions of
    docker-mailserver after 8.0.1. In case that there is not a more recent release,
    this script is currently only working with the :edge tag.

    You can download the script for your release by substituting TAG from the
    following URL, where TAG looks like 'vX.X.X':
